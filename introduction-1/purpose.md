# Purpose

Goal:&#x20;

&#x20; USER:&#x20;

1. Allow users to visualize nearby charging stations and the relative price of energy and if they provide offers. &#x20;
2. For each charging station the user can visulize the status of the relative charging points (busy or free) and  reserve the service for a certain time slot.&#x20;
3. Allow the user to start a charging process at a station.
4. Allow the user to monitor the status of the charging process with use-full data and ~~receive a notification ?~~
5. Allow the user to pay for the service.
6. Gives users suggestion about the optimal schedule to charge the vehicle depending on battery status, schedule of the users and offers provided by CPOs

CPO

1. Allow CPOs dynamically decide from which DSO to acquire energy providing information of energy price.&#x20;
2. Allow CPOs dynamically decide the cost of a charging and when set special offers
3. Allow CPOs dynamically decide wheter or not to store energy their internal batteries&#x20;
4. Allow CPOs  dynamically decide , during a charging process , to use the stored energy in battery or to acquire directly from DSOs to fullfil the charge or a mix of both.
5. Allow the CPOs to know the location  of the stations and the status of their sockets.&#x20;
6. ~~start charging a vehicle according to the amount of power supplied by the socket, and monitor the charging process to infer when the battery is full;~~
